# Logo Generator
Generates a simple logo based on user input.

## Description

I built this project in order to practice using a parent class and subclasses in order to generate files based on user input. It solves the problem of having to create a new SVG file from scratch for each new iteration of the template file, as the classes serve to construct a new SVG file each time the application is invoked by typing "node index.js" in the command line. I learned about classes, inheritance (subclasses from their parent), testing code via jest, and how to organize multiple files to work together while still being intuitive for another developer to interpret quickly.
